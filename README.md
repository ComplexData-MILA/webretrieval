# Web Retrieval Agents for Evidence-Based Misinformation Detection

This repository contains the Python script for a two-agent search system designed to detect misinformation based on evidence. The approach leverages web retrieval agents to verify facts against trusted sources. For an in-depth explanation of the methodology and system architecture, please refer to our paper: [Web Retrieval Agents for Evidence-Based Misinformation Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00009).

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure that all necessary Python packages are installed. You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then, run the script using the following command:

```bash
python subprocess_verify.py
```
